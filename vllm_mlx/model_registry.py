"""
Model Registry for vllm-mlx.

Tracks which models are in use by which engines to prevent
BatchKVCache conflicts when multiple engines share a model.

The problem: mlx-lm's BatchGenerator maintains internal KV cache state
tied to the model. When multiple EngineCore instances use the same model,
the cache objects become incompatible, causing NoneType errors.

Solution: Track model ownership and ensure only one engine's BatchGenerator
is active for each model at a time.
